# StudyRoomFinder
This application allows students to identify and register study room reservations across
campus. By logging in with their RCS ID, students will preserve their identities and have a built-in method
of authenticating their reservation. They will have 3 options: to view which rooms are currently available,
to reserve a room now or later period, or to set notifications for when a specific room is available. Through
usage of this app, Study Room Finder will serve as the time and energy efficient solution for finding open
study rooms on campus.
